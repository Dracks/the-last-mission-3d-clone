# The Last Mission 3D Clone
The idea of this project is improve my skills of godot3D doing something that I've got in mind since I learned the basics of blender 3D. Create a clone of the last mission in 3D, 

If you are looking for a remake of the last mission, I recommend you this project: [Last mission](https://github.com/dmitrysmagin/last-mission)

# How to help
1. Fork the project
2. clone your fork
3. Run it with godot
4. If you wish there is a small startup script that will allow you to skip the main menu, you need to create a start.json file with the following content:
```
{
  "start": "game"
}
```
5. Modify code, add assets, etc. 
6. Create P/R to my project
